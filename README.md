### Searching for Recipes

All users can peruse recipes via featured ones on the splash page or through the index. From here we can search for recipes via recipe ingredients or the names of these dishes.

Recipes have ratings which are accessed via their association to comments which may/may not have a rating attached to them.

### Recipes, Ingredients, and Steps

Upon clicking a recipe, a payload organized by appropriate keys in our jbuilder files. This helps to reduces complexity and requires less logic in the frontend.
